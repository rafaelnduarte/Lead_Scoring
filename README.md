**Lead Scoring** is a method of ranking and prioritizing potential customers or leads based on their level of interest and engagement with a company's products or services. It involves assigning a numerical value or score to each lead based on their behavior and demographics, such as website visits, email opens, and job title.

> The purpose of lead scoring is to identify which leads are most likely to convert into customers and which ones require more nurturing. By focusing on the most promising leads, companies can maximize their sales efforts and improve their return on investment.

### This Project

In this project, we're analyzing Leads Data for a company, in order to identify the clients that are most likely to be converted.

This way, we can direct our efforts into clients that would have a higher conversion rate when compared to the rest of the leads base.
